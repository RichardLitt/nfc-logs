Live listening: [2:20,6:50]
Notes: Heard something weird at 2:27am, which continued for a while - probably a raccoon or an opposum, possibly a squirrel. Constant noises throughout for the next thirty minutes or so. Also, heard a crow at around 1:00am, if I recall correctly. Didn't note any NFCs at all, although there was a constant clicking noise every minute or so that kept throwing me off until I learned to ignore it. Possible NSWO at 2:52am. Went outside - it was a train. Nevermind. Clear, cool night, no wind, no moon - it set at around 10:00. Would be a good night for owling, but I am going to bed. Went through and found other files from the day manually.

Notes: I tried to change the buckets today and it totally fucked everything. I then recorded for hours, but ISound never started, of course, which sucks. Switched it, hope I got it. Also seems super quiet - nothing I can do about it, though. Not sure why this sucks so bad.

Notes: Heard AMWO just before turning off the mic for the night. Uploaded eBird checklist. https://ebird.org/checklist/S85436664

Location: Moose Bog
Notes: Started recording slightly before 10. Heard BOOW at 9:58. 14:00 minutes in matched 22:12.

BOOW call only occurred once, as far as I can tell. Cleaner than a WISN.

Not sure what the repeated pings are on the mic. Seems odd.
