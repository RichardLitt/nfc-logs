Notes: Heard something weird at 2:27am, which continued for a while - probably a raccoon or an opposum, possibly a squirrel. Constant noises throughout for the next thirty minutes or so. Also, heard a crow at around 1:00am, if I recall correctly. Didn't note any NFCs at all, although there was a constant clicking noise every minute or so that kept throwing me off until I learned to ignore it. Possible NSWO at 2:52am. Went outside - it was a train. Nevermind. Clear, cool night, no wind, no moon - it set at around 10:00. Would be a good night for owling, but I am going to bed. Went through and found other files from the day manually.
