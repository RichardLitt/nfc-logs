I feel like I should remove birds from the quick-call sorting on Vesper which I know I can't ID. I need to go through and do that. For now, it's too quick to suggest some birds I don't know, and this will be a good way to catch up. For instance, remove all zeep complexes except LOWA and BBWA, which are the only distinctive ones, IIRC.

Also, 'zeep' calls should automatically suggest warbler sp. No sparrows coming through yet - passerine is overdoing it.
