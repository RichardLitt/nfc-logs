Recorded from 22:42:50. Stopped at 23:31. Heard my first BADO. Lots and lots of sparrows.

Reset tonight. Started the recording at 7:57, which is pretty much right on time (off by a minute or so, I think). Watched actively from beginning of recording while doing things around the house. Still elated about BADO last night.

Stopped at 1:15. 5:18 minutes into recording.
