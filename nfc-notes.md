Started recording at 22:12 due to technical error. I'm not sure what the error was. Perhaps I changed the scheduler and didn't restart the program?

I had tried copying things over from the other computer. This appears to have failed.

Listened live 22:12

Lost the entire day by accident, even though I listened to it for a while. The file wasn't saved.

This night, Vesper totally failed. I recorded far more birds than Vesper noted, including BICKs and RBGR that it just doesn't see. Vesper doesn't adequately get calls, either - all of the tseeps seemed muted, but I could hear them fine on Audacity. Something to be wary about.

#### 2020-10-01

Mic cable was hit, so lost everything before 23:10. I should complain to Bill and get a new one.

Started: 23:10
Stopped: Midnight

end: 2:12

- Loaded into Vesper. Identified a couple of birds - not many.
- Loaded 2:12-> dawn tseeps onto the remote eBird. Didn't load thrushes, as I think there's more to identify there.
